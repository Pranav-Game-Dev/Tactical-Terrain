# 📚 Tactical-Terrain

Welcome to Tactical-Terrain, a 3D tactics game developed as an assignment project. In this game, you'll experience the basics of grid-based movement and simple AI behavior within a tactical environment. Navigate your player across tiles while being pursued by an enemy in a strategic dance of positioning!

## 🎮 Game Overview
Tactical-Terrain is a single-player game where the objective is to move your player across a grid while avoiding the enemy that follows you. There is no combat; the challenge lies in continuous movement and evasion. All o fthe assets used in game are made by me.

## 🖥️ Main Features
- **Player Movement**: Move your player across the grid.
- **Enemy AI**: An enemy that follows your movements.
- **Grid System**: A dynamic grid where the gameplay takes place.
- **Pathfinding**: Both player and enemy use pathfinding algorithms for movement.

## 📋 How It Works
1. **Start the Game**: Load the game and begin your tactical evasion.
2. **Move the Player**: Use the mouse to select tiles and move your player.
3. **Enemy Follows**: The enemy will track and follow your movements.
4. **Keep Moving**: Stay ahead and strategize your movements to avoid the enemy.
